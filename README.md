Digital Image Processing Project
This project encompasses several key areas of digital image processing and machine learning using Python. The primary objectives include:

1. Face Recognition
Using computer vision techniques to identify and verify human faces in images.

2. Fruit Recognition

Developing a model to classify different types of fruits from images.


3. Handwritten Digit Recognition
Implementing a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.


4. Image Processing
Applying various image processing techniques to enhance, filter, and transform images.


5. Finger Counting
Using computer vision and hand tracking to count the number of fingers shown in an image.


Libraries and Tools
Streamlit: For building an interactive web application to showcase the project.
OpenCV: For various image processing tasks and computer vision functionalities.
MediaPipe: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
TensorFlow: For training and deploying machine learning models.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling data arrays.
OS, SYS: For interacting with the operating system and handling file system operations.

Project Structure
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collecting datasets for face images, fruit images, and handwritten digits.
Preprocessing the data (e.g., resizing, normalization).

2. Model Training
Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for face, fruit, and digit recognition tasks.
Evaluating model performance and tuning hyperparameters.

3. Image Processing Techniques
Implementing image enhancement, filtering (e.g., Gaussian blur, edge detection), and transformation techniques.

4. Hand and Finger Detection
Utilizing MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking.
Counting fingers based on the tracked landmarks.

5. Web Application
Building a Streamlit web application to demonstrate the functionalities of the project.
Providing an interactive interface for users to upload images and see the results of the image processing and recognition tasks.
